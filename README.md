# TrcScoutingApp
An Android app for FIRST Tech Challenge scouting. (Work In Progress)

# How To Use
- Desktop: go into TrcScoutingApp-Desktop and compile it using javac, or with an IDE. 
- Phone/Tablet: Import this entire folder into Android Studio or Eclipse w/ Android build plugins, and hit build. Then use ADB to sideload the apk onto the tablet.
Remember that because this app is intended to be adapted from year to year, the scouting options at the bottom will change from year to year. They have been kept right now at 2 sample conditions; you may modify this to your own needs. Modifying these conditions will also require modifying the parser (in SetCompetitionName.java) to export these conditions to .CSV file correctly.

- Windows 7,8,10
- Mac OS X Snow Leopard, Yosemite, El Capitan, High Sierra
